While there have been great strides in NLP in the past few decades based on linguistic studies and machine learning, the focus has been only on a few of the world\u0027s languages. We live in a multilingual world with 7000 living languages. We will present algorithms that can bootstrap the effort to bring NLP technology to the less resourced languages. The use of neural networks and representation learning methods in NLP has opened up opportunities of transfer learning to benefit low resource languages."
