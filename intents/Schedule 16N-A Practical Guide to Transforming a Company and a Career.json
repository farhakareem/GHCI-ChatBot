Most companies who attempt to transform, despite investing time and dollars, fail. Common pitfalls are lack of clarity around what a company wants to accomplish, trying to take on too much. Sheila Rohra as the Chief Transformation Officer helped lead the unique turnaround of NetApp, a Fortune 500 company. After many quarters of falling revenue and declining profit, NetApp engaged the entire workforce in transforming the company resulting in a phenomenal turnaround that investors, employees, partners, and customers recognize. Sheila will share the practical approach that has helped guide both the transformation of a company and the development of her own career. This session occurs Friday, November 16 at 0900, and will feature a moderated Q\u0026A. How else can I help you?"
