This brings challenging yet interesting dimensions into the current design paradigms defined solely for traditional two-dimensional user interfaces. The focus of the hands-on workshop is to create awareness about human perceptions like spatial audio, head tracking, acceleration, cone of vision and several other design influencers that are tailored specifically for immersive three-dimensional(3d) experiences. Participants will learn by applying these design principles to a real-world design challenge while creating low fidelity design prototypes that can be experienced through a VR web viewer or VR headset. They will take away knowledge and tools required to design immersive solutions. How else can I help you?"
