The need to protect data in a secure way is of paramount priority in Aviation Industry which aligns perfectly with what Blockchain has to offer. ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) is the key technology that is mandated by FAA in US by 2020, to maintain safe separation between aircrafts and accommodate more aircrafts within a specified air space at any point in time. However, The question of concern is that the ADS-B data is neither Encrypted nor Authenticated. ADS-B messages can be trivially injected, modified or deleted by an attacker who has full control over the wireless channel. In this session let\u0027s take a look at whether it is possible that Blockchain Technology can be used to secure ADS-B applications while still maintaining the transparency of the data."
