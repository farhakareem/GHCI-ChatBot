          "speech": "Memory-Driven Computing is a future system architecture being developed by HPE that brings together fast persistent memory, a fast memory fabric, task-specific processing, and a new software stack to address today’s data growth and analytics challenges. The memory hierarchy will include a capacity tier provided by a large pool of shared persistent memory that’s directly accessible over a memory-semantic (i.e., load/store) fabric, as well as a performance tier provided by local private memory. Memory-Driven Computing refers to this paradigm shift in computer architecture, to a more memory-centric model from the traditional processor centric model. This presentation covers an overview of Memory-Driven Computing (MDC), the technology trends enabling Memory-Driven Computing, the benefits MDC provides to applications, along with a specific case study drawn from initial experiences in The Machine.
