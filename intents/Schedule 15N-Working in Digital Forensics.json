So, much more important than the tools, investigation requires meticulous, painstaking, detailed work. This talk will look at these two dimensions so as to highlight the following points – the needs for/of investigations, the methods used and the research and development required. Focus however is on the people because investigation depends on the skills of the individual and not just on making a newer/better tool. Anything else that you would like to know about?"
