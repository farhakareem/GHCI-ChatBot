Hence, Hinton et al, proposed a layered architecture called Capsule Networks (Capsnets) to overcome these shortcomings by replacing pooling techniques with dynamic routing abilities between lower level and higher level neural units which better capture hierarchical relationships within the data, thus, outperforming traditional systems.How else can I help you ?"
