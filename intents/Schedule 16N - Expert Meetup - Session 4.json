Now you can get to know them and their journey a little more and ask all the questions you have always wanted to ask through the expert meet up sessions. Our speakers will spend 60-min with the delegates in an informal setting enabling a more open interaction. This is a great opportunity for one to get to know their role models and the inside stories that made them who they are. How else can I help you?"
