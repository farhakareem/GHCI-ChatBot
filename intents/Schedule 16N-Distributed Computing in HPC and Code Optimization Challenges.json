We focus on distributed memory computing and concepts related to scalability on a large cluster, and also some of the interesting use cases that were solved using HPC compute power. The session includes a small demo of how a sample application code can use the benefits of the underlying hardware to achieve better performance through the use of compilers and performance tools. How else can I help you?"
