The speed, agility and precision brought by Robotics has enabled to increase the throughput to fulfill consumer demand. This talk would provide a bird\u0027s eye-view of the evolution of Robotics Development with an eye to the future with cool demos through the session.1.Robots of Yesterday: Evolution of Robots with examples of some versatile robots and the tasks they perform. We will discuss Automation, Mechatronics and the impact in the industry so far. . 2.Robots of Today: How ML \u0026 IoT are influencing the Robotics industry by bringing in efficiencies, predictive maintenance and better asset monitoring leading to lesser downtime and losses. 3.Robots of Tomorrow: We will talk about how VR would integrate into the field of Robots to shape the factories of tomorrow and our lives at large. How else may I help you?"
